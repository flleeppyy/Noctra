<p><strong> Psydonia </strong> - The world Vanderlin takes place in, named after its creation god, Psydon. It is currently the year 2515 after His death. </p>
<p><strong> Faience </strong> - The continent Vanderlin takes place in. Shaped by His hand. </p>
<p><strong> Lux </strong> - The core link of divinity a person holds; the soul. A sliver of Psydon present within each species touched at one point by divine hand. It is said that it carries the power of a single, focused miracle of life- yet its removal dooms a soul never to pass into the underworld. </p>

		<summary><strong> KINGSFIELD EXPANSE </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>The Crown of Psydonia</em>
		<br><br>
		Kingsfield spans along the Northwest of Faience, housing the cultural center of the world in its massive cities and impressive population. Unlike many of the other humen-majority populations, its inhabitants and history are defined by kindness rather than conquest. A certain demographic of Kingsfieldians are identifiable by their odd pronunciation of certain Imperial words and inclusion of 'eh?' after a comment or question. Species from all over the world would visit and establish themselves within these cities, including a non-insignificant population of dark elves before Zizo's conquest. They are, perhaps, the most tolerant of half-drow as a result- and as such are subject to mockery by the rest of Faience.
		<br><br>
		Kingsfield's prominence was built from tactical allyship and infrastructure development through industrialization. Through close cooperation with Heartfelt, Kingsfield railways span across the Western side of the entire continent, stretching from the tip of Kingsfield's tundras to the bottom of Vanderlin's peninsula. Kingsfield's population, notable in arts and culture worldwide, is of course largely Eoran and Xylixian in patronage; however, scholars of Noc account for a close third.

		<summary><strong> EMPIRE OF WINTERMARE </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>Noc's Embraced, The Elven Empire, The Arcyne Tundra</em>
		<br><br>
		Wintermare is the largest elven power in Psydonia, often the only territory marked on humen maps. Unfortunately, most of its territory is covered in unusable Northern permafrost despite its size. Nevertheless Wintermare remains incredibly influential, with most of its Southern cities producing renown magicians and Noccian scholars. Kingsfieldian rail links along the Southern mountain ranges, providing vital resources to an otherwise tense border zone between the elven empire and Grenzelhoft below.
		<br><br>
		Abandoned settlements and ghost towns along the border of Wintermare stand as graves and memorials to wars and genocides of the past. What populated locations remain are riddled with discarded and potentially active weapons of war. What don't... after Zizo's rise, no one goes there anymore.
		<br><br>
	</details>

	<details>
		<summary><strong> GRENZELHOFT IMPIRATE </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>The Black Empire, The Empty Throne, Empire of the Trident</em>
		<br><br>
		Grenzelhoft is an imperialist state carved across the Northeast of Faience through political upheaval and military action. They are known mainly for their striking cuisine, honourable, loyal mercenaries, and their overwhelming monopoly over black powder. Despite a largely humen-supremacist culture, dwarves are embraced and regarded as the friends and builders of Psydon's vision.
		<br><br>
		Grenzelhoftians proudly assimilate all humens who come under their heel into their Empire, integrating local and cultural identities into their fold before crushing them in favour of their own. Grenzelhoft bears the largest armies in the world and incredible military might, which come under vast scrutiny and disgust as they become increasingly desperate to upkeep their power. Their history is defined by crusades, elven genocide, and general aggression in the supposed name of Psydon and His return to the throne. Orthodox Psydonism is the dominant religion. Critics and pagans are persecuted.
		<br><br>
		Their people cannot remember a time when the Empire was not at war, and many have served within its military forces to escape the intense poverty of its lower-class. A world-scale conflict between Grenzelhoft and its neighbours was narrowly avoided in the early 2100s by the rise of a new common enemy: Zizo. Grenzelhoft's forces, explosives, and firearms now supply the Eastern front with vital support under the explicit command of Grenzelhoft's cabal of sun-averse counts and countesses.

	<details>
		<summary><strong> ZALADIN DYNASTY </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>The Red Sands, Empire of the Dunes, Merchants of the Pasha</em>
		<br><br>
		A grand-spanning, mercantilist empire which found prosperity and riches from spice export. Zaladin is home to some of the worlds greatest wonders, though the labourers who built them were directed by force and threats rather than passion. The dominant ideologies are Astratanism and Xylixianism. Xylixian freemen and Astratan order-keepers clash often in mortal representations of divine conflict. Zaladians have grown numb to the possibility of a civil war, and these skirmishes have simply become another aspect of daily life.
		<br><br>
		Zaladin was known as 'Zybantine' whilst under Grenzelhoftian occupation. It was a title forced upon them rather than chosen, and was violently rejected alongside the repellance of Grenzelhoft's Southern crusades by Zalad armies. In modern times, the term has become considered a grave and bigoted insult.
		<br><br>
		Within desperation after the failed conquest, Zaladin's dwindling forces turned to conscription of prisoners-of-war, the first of their slave-armies, forcefully enlisting many captured Grenzelhoftians. These troops are sent to support the front lines of allied Valorian states to the North against Zizo's armies in the Barrows. Regardless of origin, Zaladin's signature "Desert Riders" are a force to reckon- especially when mounted atop their twain-humped pegasi.

		<em> The Freestates, Vineyards of Valoria, The Lords of Coin </em>
		<br><br>
		Valoria is a land of constant strife, bickering city-states with a number of conflicting interests. Yet they bear some pride of their lands, banding together to repel the invading Grenzelhoft Empire out of shared desire for freedom. With conflict comes innovation; the Valorian lands developed pride in their revolution of blade combat strategy and stance. Largely followers of Ravox, they value honour and duels as an expression of status.
		<br><br>
		Valoria is renown for their alcohol exports and trade, seconding only Zaladin as most-sought goods.

		<br><br>
		Located in the mountains of continents all over Psydonia. The political aspects stem from federations bearing unique dwarven clans, leaderships, industries, and cultures. The largest establishment is within the great mountain range to the Southeast of Zaladin's deserts. Dwarves and humen empires have established a long history of allyship. Whilst dwarves often choose neutrality in humen-on-humen conflict, a dwarven face is a trusted face to most humens.

		<summary><strong> ELVEN ENCLAVES </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em> Keepers of Psydonia, Retreats of the Ancient Age, Forgotten Guides of Death </em>
		<br><br>
		The declining population has led Elves to retreat to compact and isolated communities outside of Wintermare. They defend their remaining homes in natural wonders around Psydonia to the death and without mercy. Subdivided into distinct cultures such as Wood, Dark, Sand, Mountain, Sea, and countless more. Whilst once there lived a culture of snow elves, Zizo's ascension resulted in an all-but complete genocide of the tribe. Most elven settlements are not even recognized, much less their their territories represented within modern humen maps.

		<summary><strong> ORC & GOBLIN THRONES  </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em> Crusaders of Graggar, Graggarspawn, Heirs of Psydonia  </em>
		<br><br>
		Spontaneous fortresses and towns of Crimsonland origin, established via nomadic means. These encampments take advantage of natural resources and nearby settlements to raid, conquer, consume, and then move on to more promising targets. They are ever-moving hordes of gluttony and rage which constantly follow a pattern of great loss followed by a steady regrowth. Most of these forces are still recovering from the most recent Goblin War.
		<br><br>
		A misogynistic and self-destructive culture to its extreme, scholars report that several terms of language have been developed just to describe masculinity. Any sane individual loses focus after an orc rambles about &Sigma;-class masculinity or whatever newest scam Graggarspawn have begun pushing. Records are sparse as a result.

		The overwhelming majority of Grenzelhoft's church of Psydon. Orthodox Psydonites believe that Psydon lives still, though divided into nine pieces. They are intent to tear down The Ten so that the true God may reform, however long it takes. They hold a deep hatred towards Necra for her butchery and betrayal of Psydon.

		<summary><strong> Progressive Psydonism </strong></summary>

		<br><br>
		Goddess of light and fire. Her domain encompasses the sun, healing, and most importantly the revival of the dead. She was crafted from the head of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Astrata leads The Ten with an iron fist.  She demands obedience and respect as she leads both the mortal and divine worlds through calamity after calamity. As time passes, her grip only gets tighter and her patience for heresy thinner. She simply cannot spare her focus. Since the 2430s, she fills the cycles of darkness with periodic flares to light the nite.

		<br>
		<em>The Moon Prince, The Keeper of Magick.</em>
		<br>
		God of knowledge and magick. His domain encompasses the moon, study, record-keeping, and self-improvement. He was crafted from the silver helm of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Noc guides scholars, often nobles, through life dedication in order to master the ways of arcyne magick. Since the ascension of Zizo, he has only grown more strict with who are worthy of practicing this gift. He is known to wear the most fabulous of dresses.

		<br>
		<span style="display:block; color:#8b2d39; font-size:120%"> "Don't be fishin' deeper than ye can catch." </span>
		<br>
		God of the sea and storms. His domain encompasses all within the oceans, water, and blood. He defends the natural world alongside his brother, Dendor. Abyssor was crafted from the drained blood of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		With the destruction of the natural world, both brothers of nature were driven mad. While Dendor was struck with insanity, Abyssor encompasses the rage of the sea. Woe be to any who offend him.

		<br>
		God of nature and beasts.  His domain encompasses the wilds on the surface, and all flora and fauna within. He does not claim any Subterran life due to its hellish corruption. Dendor was crafted from the bones of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Fallen to insanity from the world industrialization and natural decimation. His followers struggle to find meaning in his words, to commune with the growing hostility seen within the previously-pristine glades and woods. He holds a deep resentment towards Malum, and his part in the aforementioned devastation.

		<br>
		God of warfare, and justice. His domain encompasses righteous combat and bravery. He retreated to the underworld, reshaping it alongside Necra to include trials of combat and strife. He was crafted from the still-bloodied greatsword of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Sullen and withdrawn, Ravox struggles to keep his followers away from Graggarism. As he has discovered, even remaining alive is not enough to avoid his words and domain twisted into heresy. Ravoxians often argue that their ideology lies closest to Psydon's own ways, though few if any remember to a degree of certainty.

		<br>
		God of craft, forge, and toil. His domain encompasses architecture, mining, and sculpting. He considers the dwarven species his chosen, proudly supporting and guiding their technological improvements. He was crafted from the hands of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Almost equally defined by conflict as much as creation, Malum and Dendor's rivalry spans millennia. Their bickering is reflected in the mortal planes through elven and dwarven skirmishes.

		<span style="display:block; color:#e4bae6; font-size:115%"> "I will always love you, sweetheart. Regardless of the ne'er-do-wells you associate with."</span>
		<br>
		Goddess of love, family, and art. Her domain encompasses marriage, painting, singing, and literature- especially romance. She is considered the backbone of The Ten, barely able to keep them together and officially allied. She was crafted from the heart of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Despite Astrata's overt support for same-sex couples, Eora remains begrudging at best. Some theorize it is hatred, some theorize jealousy. Regardless, her failed seduction of Pestra early in their history and the Great Insult exchanged has left a lasting effect on the so-called goddess of love.

		<i><span style="display:block; color:#dfe6ba; font-size:120%"> "Please, darling. The world aaaalways needs more DRAMA!"</span></i>
		<br>
		Diety of trickery, freedom, and inspiration. Their domain encompasses friendly pranks, barding, theatre, and performance. Known widely to be genderless, as they see such concepts only as masks to play a role. They were crafted from the tongue of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Of all The Ten, Xylix is considered the most 'problem child.' Whether spats with Astrata over freedom, or making trouble for its own sake, they're something of an outcast from the orderly nature of the rest- and they are perfectly content with their position. For Xylixians, a boring life is not one worth living.

		<br>
		Goddess of disease, alchemy, and medicine. Her domain encompasses all cycles of change; from rot and decay to refinement and transformation. The domain of alchemy is a subject of dispute between Pestra and Noc frustratingly often for her taste, but she retains firm hold. She was a mistake, slithering out of Psydon's intestines left behind.
		<br><br>
		Despite closeness with Astrata, Pestra remains something of an outcast amongst The Ten due to her accidental origin. Her Great Insult of rebuffal towards Eora only further damaged ties, though Pestra thrives in her isolation. To her, it's simply less chains restraining experimentation.

		<i><span style="display:block; color:#5a53d5; font-size:125%"> "Allow me serenity for once, child. A brief respite. Calamity surely strikes again soon..." </span></i>
		<br>
		Goddess of death and time. Once a close partner to Psydon. She was the first mortal, the first to die, and the second to achieve godhood. Her domain encompasses passing spirits, the underworld, and the cycle of reincarnation. She created the other Nine from her butchery of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Necra is most controversial amongst The Ten. She is reviled for her butchery and perceived betrayal of Psydon by those faithful to Him, yet is defended by Tennites across the land claiming she acted out of necessity. The exact circumstances of Psydon's death are unclear, but Necra is surely responsible- and she makes no effort to hide it.

		<span style="display:block; color:#17181a; font-size:120%"> "What I say is nonya business, asshole." </span>
		<br>
		God of thievery, ill-gotten gains, and highwaymen. A figure shrouded in mystery. While assumed to once have been humen, there are no records of his appearance. His very feats were spread by word-of-mouth and rumour, with little ties to any tangible figure. He was the first of The Four to ascend.
		<br><br>
		Matthios is used as a figurehead by bandits and oppressed peasants alike. While his exact beliefs are unknown, his hatred for nobility specifically is apparent. He would quench his insatiable greed with their coffers over most others. He is hailed as a figure of rebellion, of freedom similar to Xylix who resonates with those who've felt abandoned by The Ten.
		<br><br>
		Upon his ascension, an otherworldly tomb's entrances began appearing around the world. The Tomb of Matthios promised riches, rewards, but equal danger. Most who enter only manage to join his collection, or fall victim to the roaming bands of orcs and goblins within.

		<br>
		Goddess of drugs, self-preservation, and remorseless Joy. The first tiefling; an 'exotic' consort-turned-regent whose self-indulgence sent her once-thriving kingdom careening into ruin. She preaches "Joy at all costs!" to her followers. She was the second of The Four to ascend.
		<br><br>
		A Baothan follower is unmistakable. Brightly-dyed hair to make Eora weep, ridiculous slang to make listeners' ears bleed, a taste in music that's out-of-this-world, and sobriety, of course, a foreign concept. The status quo exists to be subverted. Only through rebellious joy is this failing world worth living... there's no use trying to save it.
		<br><br>
		Baotha's ascension marked the spread of her kind, tieflings, across Psydonia. The anomaly became a species all at once, in an event known as The Hellspawn Scourge. Her voice began to whisper in the ears of drunkards, addicts, and the hopeless- preaching not a better future, but a bliss to distract oneself from it.

		<br>
		God of unnatural beasts, unsated consumption, and unbridled hatred. Known as the Dark Sini-Star to faithful and foes alike. The first orc, a warlord notorious for consuming fallen opponents in ritualistic feasting. He was the third of The Four to ascend.
		<br><br>
		Followers of Graggar put women in their place. Graggarism is a culture built on strength, misogyny, and glee in the destruction or corruption of what exists. It's an addictive, never-ending hunger of flesh, gorging until one's skin turns green and they sprout tusks. Resist the cravings as long as you can, fool. They consume all.

		Eora took pity upon Graggar as he ascended, extending some of her own divinity in attempt to heal the man she foolishly thought she could 'fix.' Graggar was gracious, of course, as he crafted with this sliver hordes of goblins and outlandish monsters to terrorize Psydonia for eternity onwards. He cackles about her naivety to this day.

		<i><span style="display:block; color:#791f3f; font-size:125%"> "It is only a matter of time before this order falls. Will you choose the rright side?" </span></i>
		<br>
		Goddess of forbidden magicks, domination, and power. A snow-elven lich who achieved godhood through the sacrifice of her entire people. She conquered the dark elven empire, reshaping it violently into the evil it stands today. She was the final mortal to ascend... for now.
		<br><br>
		Followers of Zizo put men in their place. Zizonic culture is a misandristic terror of back-stabbing and plots in the shadows. None are safe from betrayal in order to secure a position to serve The Queen. Avid practitioners of fleshcrafting and subverters of Noc's Arcyne, Zizonians believe that magick should be available to all with the drive to stand up and <em>take it.</em>
		<br><br>
		Necra's millennium-spanning rules of life and death were all but shattered upon Zizo's ascension. Corpses no longer lied to rest, instead emerging after several minutes to walk and feast again on the living, spreading their curse of death. The deadite plague was the most impactful calamity to ever strike Psydonia. Society was only barely able to adapt and move forward with their new reality, and could not aid the dark elven empire in their defense against the lich queen's armies.

		Humens come from a vast swathe of cultures and ethnicities all around Psydonia, most of which have historically been at odds with both one another and other species. With their tenacity and overwhelming population, humens tend to outnumber the other species drastically. Their saturation leads to most world maps representing humen borders and states over other species'. Humens tend to find fortune easier than the other species, and are so diverse that no other trait is dominant...

		<summary><strong> Elves </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Elves, created by Necra to guide humenity, are characterized by lengthened age, low fertility, and a magical aptitude originating from a vast array of tribal cultures. With the ascension of Zizo, the entire culture of snow-elves was all but destroyed, leading the remaining tribes to live in fear and paranoia of suffering the same fate. Many elves sought safety through mixing culture, positioning themselves under the watchful guard of their stronger humen counterparts. A longstanding feud remains between elves and dwarves. Elvenkind has yet to forgive the dwarves for their destruction of homeland and pillaging of natural resources within the former snow-elf territory. To elves, it was the greatest disrespect to those lost.

		The child of an Elf and a Humen. Half-Elves are generally frowned upon by more conservative peoples, although as species tensions lower, more and more half-elves are being born- to the point that some scholars worry someday it may be impossible to distinguish the two species. Half-Elves are extraordinarily diverse, as they combine both Humen and Elvish culture. It is widely considered that Half-Elf culture is simply a melting pot of various others condensing into one vibrant entity. With their longevity spanning too long for a human and too short for an elf, they tend to congregate together. Depending on their heritage, Half-Elves tend to gain species traits depending on how strong their fathers, or mothers, genes were. Half-Elves typically struggle to find their own identity.

		Shaped by Psydon and Necra, chosen by Malum. A proud and robust species of vertically challenged folk, dwarves are known for their martial strength and their tenacity towards their ancient customs of craft and honour. Dwarves hold a strong alliance with humenkind and have done so throughout history, as was their original purpose decreed by Psydon. A Dwarf, much like the rock that they carve their fortress out of, is stubborn and ancient. They are revered craftsmen, sculptors, smiths, and miners. As an old and mostly out-of-date saying goes, "If you want it done right, lose 2 feet and grow a beard." Despite their cultural praise, a long-standing feud remains between dwarves and elves stemming from old industrial practices.

This species is often revered due to their celestial origin, but face great solitude as not many of their kind exist. Many an aasimar will detest the reverence in which they are greeted with, for their greatest failure or unuse that lead to their discarding is not subject for celebration. An aasimar may be crafted with any number of materials. Many resemble sculptures of stone or are ceramic in skin, but their insides are just as mortal as any other. Most Aasimar were created to serve The Ten, and few if any Psydonic Aasimar remain to this day- decrepit husks of what were once great warriors.

	<br><br>

	<details>
		<summary><strong> Tritons </strong></summary>
		<br>
		The Children of Abyssor, also known as Tritons or their colloquial name, "Deep Folk,"  are a strange species of people that live under the waves of Psydonia. Born from creatures of the deep with Abyssor's guidance, these aquatic wayfarers all share a few common traits.
		<br><br>
		Similar to other creatures that dwell below the surface, their eyes are dull with disuse. Tritons feel pain when gazing upon that which direct light of Astrata herself illuminates.
		<br><br>
		 Unlike most of the people of Psydonia, their culture is often considered cold and dour; an apathetic attitude to most negative or positive news. For them, the depths of Psydonia's oceans are cold and unforgiving. Large beasts travel the waters that swallow their kin whole...  but the crushing depths have provided them a hearty disposition and resistance to most threats. Born of Abyssor, their normally placid emotions can swing into a wild rage when they view injustice done upon their kin at the hands of a sapient being.
		 <br><br>
		 Tritons seen on the surface are very important trade partners, mercenaries, and surprising academics.  Merchants often spend vast amounts of coin to have them aboard their trade vessels, fending off pirates or guiding their boats through turbulent weather. Be it on or within the sea, they excel- on land, however, they struggle. With their awkward and gangly fins, long, sharp talons, ghastly, lipless teeth, and milky, foreign eyes, they seem unfit to walk amongst the people. Humen children are often afraid of them due to such appearances.
		 <br><br>
		 Their species is not without its tribalism, however. Large sections of their kin have broken away form their father,  to consider themselves Noc's chosen. Due to their extreme sexual dimorphism similar to that of the common angler, males of this species are more likely to pursue magick with their weaker frames compared to their stronger female counterparts.

		<summary><strong> Medicators / "Feculents" </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Medicators originate from the the fetid swamps and murk within the Isle of Enigma. Their species has historically been localized around the area, although the Brass Cataclysm of Heartfelt's fall has resulted in droves of their kind seeking refuge elsewhere. They are a newer form of sapience, with records dating back only after Zizo's ascension.
		<br><br>
		Their appearance is gaunt, patches of bare skin riddled with feathers and pox scars, Medicators are a horrifying fusion of bird and men- unlike their far more appealing adversaries, the harpies. With long, hanging beaks which clatter as they breathe, other species find them displeasing at best and repulsive at worst. Despite this, their eyes betray great intelligence behind otherwise monstrosity.
		<br><br>
		Born of carcinogens, pollution, mechanical and biological waste, these creatures were not always sapient. Through their appearance, accidental origin, and innate sicknesses, they have gained the fascination and uplifting of Pestra and inherited aspects of the serpentine goddess in turn. Medicators, as they called themselves, carry with them the bedside manners, or lack thereof, of the worst Pestrans. Their culture holds discovery and medicinal breakthroughs in the highest regard, be it through experimentation to shift their own ailments or others'. Medicators care little about the nickname granted to them by other species, 'feculents,' so long as their medical prowess is not subject to question.
		<br><br>
		Medicators and Harpies often find themselves in conflict, mirroring the quarrels of their patrons, whether of conscious faith or not.

		<summary><strong> Harpies </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Harpies, or less ceremoniously known as 'magpies,' resemble the despised hollow-kin in appearance at first glance. One would rightfully assume they are similar in nature- with accuracy even, much to the harpies' chagrin. Harpies have been uplifted and reconnected to divinity by Eora, having developed culture of music and song which caught the attention of such a goddess. Their songs and voices may be their own, or proud mimicking other voices they've heard with unnatural accuracy.
		<br><br>
		Whilst harpies may fly, their freedom is weighed by corruption of fleshcrafting to this day. Complete open-air freedom is still foreign to them. Harpies tend to live and gather in colonies at the tops of great sequoia forests and in nearby cliffs. Due to their laden flight, they must employ use of updrafts and proximity to large objects or structures to bolster their limited range and air-dancing performances. Their serene songs and blissful music can be heard echoing far below, guiding travelers and thieves both to respite... or treasure. For as lifted into grace as they might be, these 'magpies' earn such a nickname from instinctual Matthiosan greed and love for anything that shines. Yet if one can work past that distrust and compensate them well, harpies make for unparalleled couriers.

	<details>
		<summary><strong> Tieflings </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Also known as Infernal-Spawn, Hell-Bloods, Surface-Devils, and perhaps in a more humorous manner, <em>thief</em>-lings. Their treatment ranges from shunning to distrust, depending on the region. Shopkeeps and merchants always keep a wary eye on any tiefling passersby. The resentment feed into itself, leading to higher rates of tiefling ire and thievery against other species. Many tieflings resign to seeking a solitary and nomadic life, huddled in groups outside the watchful eyes of others. They also tend to be extremely perceptive and paranoid, as luck is rarely on their side.
		<br><br>
		Tieflings began appearing all over Psydonia after Baotha's ascension within the 21st century, and were exiled in droves as the world adapted. They are often mistaken as being related to her.
		<br><br>
		Tieflings are incapable of reproducing with mortals, and thus are spawn of either devils, demons, or other tieflings. A tiefling may develop any number of hellish features, a wide range of horns, potential hooves, odd spines and spikes, or scales. Oddly positioned scales, hollow bones, and other varying oddities that appear consistently in tiefling biology make them considerably fragile. It is not uncommon for a tiefling to be generally unpleasant to look at in the eye of the commonfolk. As if to make matters worse, their hellish progenitors have left them a destiny of misfortune, though perhaps their immunity to fire opens new opportunities for them...

		<summary><strong> Half dark-elves / "Half-drow" </strong></summary>
		<br>
		The child of a dark elf and humen. The distinction between half-elves and 'half-drow' has been a subject of debate for centuries. While similar in physicality and longevity to their non-drow cousins, their origins cause them to face discrimination akin to their elven side. Groups of half-elves and half-drow have been known to congregate together and consider themselves one species. According to some radical academic scholars, they might be one and the same species indeed- yet the people of Psydonia certainly do not believe the same at large.
		<br><br>

	<details>
		<summary><strong> Dark-elves </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Zizo's conquered. These elves hail from an underground expanse of newly-reborn empires.  They lead harsh, matriarchal lives under the watchful gaze of Zizo, the vast majority hoping to one day achieve such power and domination for themselves.
		<br><br>
		Zizo's spawn, the last snow elves, integrated themselves- whether gleefully or resentfully- within the dark elf culture their grandmother had carved through conquest.
		<br><br>
		To most in Psydonia, a dark elf is nothing more than a servant of Zizo waiting to betray for power, leading most dark elves to remain within their safe underground strongholds. Those who breach the surface rarely receive fair treatment. Dark elves over 500 years old may remember their Ravoxian empire of old, yet few remain who were not killed or converted.

		<summary><strong> Half-orcs </strong></summary>
		<br>
		The bastards of Graggar. Half-orcs are the offspring of orcs and another species, half-orcs, or another species who has consumed much kinsflesh on their way to orcishness.  An outsider cannot tell a half-orc product of heritage or cannibalism at a glance, leading to much social ostracization.
		<br><br>
		Due to their parent's refusal to nurture them, as well as their other parent often rejecting or attacking them, most half-orcs will grow as orphans. Their rejection by the rest of society causes their growth to stunt, often making them hostile and prone to violence. Because of this, most will assume the worst in them, believing that they are cursed to follow their orcish parent's footsteps in the gorging of kin-flesh.
		<br><br>
		A half-orc may display orcish features, sporting tusks and natural strength. Many are nigh-indistinguishable visually from full orcs, save for their remaining grasp on self-control.

	<details>
		<summary><strong> Hollowkin </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Hollowkin are short lived, widely diverse, and have an insatiable hatred for dark elves. This hate stems from their long standing political neighbor and rival, the Zizonic dark-elven kingdoms of Subterra. Dendor and Xylix stand as the 'patron-deities' of this species despite having no hand in their creation. Hollowkin view freedom to be of the upmost importance due to their dark-elven neighbors' tendencies toward slavery and their own history of subjugation. They also, often mistakenly, worship Dendor for the boon of their animalistic nature, perceiving him as the source of their traits, talents, and instinct.
		<br><br>
		Their true origin is much darker. Hollowkin are the product of dark-elven ingenuity and fleshcrafting. Their creation is a simple story of malice and greed- of sapient animal hybrid slave homunculi, a person turned product which they could market and sell to other great houses of modern Zizonic Subterra. The true nature of their existence is largely lost to the hollowkin through centuries. The dark elves still recall, of course, viciously mocking their creations from deep within their caves, declaring them but nothing more than animals or pets. Hollowkin react violently to dark-elven attempts at oppression, this leads to conflicts across the world of Psydonia.
		<br><br>
		 To the unaligned observer, hollowkin are often seen amongst bandit bands, working openly with Agents of Matthios, conflating the idea of freedom between the two deities. There is, of course, the old wives' tales that circulate... how hollowkin lead to infestations of Werewolves. Whether this is true or not is unknown to the common person, but to those familiar with the horrendous magics used by the dark elves, they must only assume the worst.

		Speculated to have originated from the dank depths of Subterra, Kobolds are a species of stout sea-faring and mountain-dwelling lizardfolk infamous for their skills in trap-making, their habit of hoarding grandiose amounts of trinkets and artifacts, and their opportunism. They are often found in servitude to great beasts such as dragons and giants - trapping their lairs and utilizing pack tactics to dispose of ambitious adventurers and thieves alike. But in their lonesome, Kobolds are generally weak and quick to die, as they noticeably lack the meaningful amount of constitution, strength, and endurance that other species usually have.

The entire reserve was missing, leaving only the bloodied coins typical of Matthiosan calling card and no otherwise visible signs of entry.

Her tastes and demands for increasingly exotic substances further doomed her kingdom day after day, until the once thriving azure coasts held nothing but memories of struggle and suffering.
		<br><br>
		Nobility and peasantry cheered alike when word spread of her death. Overdose of Lux, they said. A blight across the lands lifted... or so was thought. Her dark whispers reached more and more ears, of drunkards, the miserable, offering a false salvation of escape. To make matters worse, Her Grace, The First Tiefling's ascension marked the emergence of even more of her people across all of Psydonia.

Parents across Psydonia birthed, hatched, or otherwise found unexpected surprises of hell-tainted children bearing half their features. Most hadn't the slightest explanation to this. Many blamed the influence of recently-ascended Baotha, yet the new goddess seemed insistent to deny that out of any aspect of her life.
		<br><br>
		After rejection and expulsion from nation after nation, tiefling culture developed around a nomadic lifestyle. As time passed, some were even allowed to integrate themselves within lower echelons of humen society. Yet all nobility agreed on one aspect; no tiefling would ever preside over a court again, much less allowed the grace of divine noble blood at all.

The attempt at world conquest was crushed after two years of humenity's efforts to resist the calamity proved fruitful.

		The snow-elven lich Zizo, after having grown in power and isolation for centuries, finally made her move. She forcefully stole the souls of her entire people, sparing only her descendants. Using the sheer power of captured divinity, she took her position as the fourth ascended goddess. As she grew higher and tested the limits of her newfound power, the very rules of death twisted.
